# Pig Dice Game
My take on the popular JavaScript dice game!

Two players take turns playing in rounds.
In a round, a player rolls a single die as many times as they wish, with the sum of their rolls becoming their current score for that round.
If the player rolls a 1, their score for that round becomes 0 and the other player takes a turn.
At any point in time, the current play may choose to hold, which adds their current score to their total score, and the play passes to the other player.
The first player whose total score reaches a pre-decided target score wins the game.
